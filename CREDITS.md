## Sly Flourish

The whole approach to session prep is taken from Sly Flourish's [Lazy DM](https://slyflourish.com/eight_steps_2023.html) method.  It's a great way to focus on what's most important, and it's amazing that he's been so generous to make it available for free under a Creative Commons license.  You can see the entire first book on the topic [here](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_dungeon_master_cc.html).

## Typescript Types

I seriously doubt this would have been possible without the [FVTT-Types project](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types) from League of Foundry Developers.  Those folks have been working through a ton of typescript insanity so the rest of us don't have to.

## Translators

Translations currently provided by AI. Let me know if you'd like me to a) add a language or b) want to manually submit an improved translation for anything.
