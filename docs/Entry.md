# Entry Window
![Entry Window](assets/images/entry-content.webp)

Regardless of Topic, each Entry has a similar layout in the main window.  At the bottom of this description, we'll outline the things that are different.

## Entry header
The entry header has three main components:
1. Name - This is where you edit the Entry's name.
2. Generate Button (for Characters, Locations, and Organizations)[Advanced Feature] - This gives you the option to generate a description or image for the current entry.  See [TODO-Generate Window] for more details.
3. Tags - In the tags input, you can assign tags to your entry.  To create a new tag, simply type it in and hit Enter/Tab.  As you type, you'll get an auto-complete showing other tags you've already used.  Tags are Topic-specific.  So, for example, if you are in a Location and another Location has been tagged "Region", then you will see "Region" available as an auto-complete.  If you are in an Organization, you won't see that tag available.  Within a topic, a given tag is assigned a random color, but that color will be the same across all Entries with that tag, making it easy to identify.  Tags are given strong preference when searching [TODO: link search] (the same as name), so they are a powerful way to find your entries quickly.
