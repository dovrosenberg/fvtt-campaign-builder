# The Directory Sidebar

The directory sidebar is a panel on the right side of the Campaign Builder window that displays tree views of all your worlds, campaigns, and everything in them.

The sidebar can be dragged to make it wider or narrower.  You can also click the tab to make it close/open completely.

By default, the sidebar is open whenever you open the Campaign Builder window.  There is a module setting to change this behavior to instead start collapsed.

## The world directory (aka the entry directory)
The top half of the diretory sidebar is the world directory.  Also known as the entry directory, this is where you can find all of entries (character, locations, organizations, and events) of your worlds.

Each world has a header, and you click the world name to make it the active world.....

[TODO: flesh this out; pics, dragging up/down, context menus, add world button, filter, group by type]

## The campaign directory
The bottom half of the directory sidebar is the campaign directory.  This shows all of the campaigns for the currently active world.  If you want to see campaigns for a different world, you need to change the world first.
