# Search
The top right corner of the window's title bar has the search box.

![search](assets//images/search.webp)

Search terms are not case sensitive.  Clicking a search result opens it in a new tab.

This box searches all entries, looking across these fields:
* Name
* Tags
* Description
* Topic
* Type 
* Species for Characters 
* Names and roles of relationships  [TODO: link to relationships]

So, searching for "Sally sibling" would return an entry with a relationship of "sibling" to a Character named Sally.  That result would be lower on the list, though, than Sally herself.

The box also searches across campaigns - but in a subtlely different way.  It looks across:
* Notes and the Session Start text
* Related items - **BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE MARKED AS DELIVERED**
  * Lore, Vignettes (text of the lore/Vignette)
  * Locations, NPCs, Items, Monsters (the name of the entity)

Only delivered items are searched because this provides a really easy way to answer things like "what session was that when we fought the Goblin King?"  If you had attached the Goblin King to multiple sessions, because it kept slipping, this will find where they actually appeared.  (Of course, you should have been [TODO-link] moving the Goblin King to subsequent sessions so it shouldn't appear anywhere it wasn't delivered, but...)

*Note: a side-effect of this is that things in the current session won't be found.  But you should have a pretty good idea of what's in the current session, and you can easily pull it up in any case.*
