# User Guide

Welcome to the World & Campaign Builder user guide. This guide will help you understand how to use the module effectively for your worldbuilding and campaign management needs.

## Overview

The World & Campaign Builder module is designed to support the full cycle of preparation and playing your game. The general flow of using the module is:

1. **Build your world** - Create characters, locations, organizations, and events with detailed descriptions and images
2. **Prep for a session** - Plan your upcoming session using the Lazy DM method or your preferred approach
3. **Play your game** - Reference your prep, create new elements on the fly, and record important details
4. **Record the results** - Capture what happened during the session to flesh out your world

## Module Interface

The module adds a new button to the Foundry VTT sidebar. Clicking this button opens the World & Campaign Builder interface, which has several tabs:

- **Worlds** - Manage your worlds and their contents
- **Campaigns** - Manage your campaigns and sessions
- **Directory** - Browse all your world entries
- **Search** - Search across all your content
- **Settings** - Configure module settings

Each section of this user guide will walk you through the different aspects of using the module.
