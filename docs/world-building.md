## World Building

The World Building section allows you to create and manage all the elements of your world. Each element can have detailed descriptions, images, and relationships with other elements.

### Characters

Characters represent the people (or other sentient beings) in your world. They can be linked to Foundry Actors for easy access during gameplay.

To create a character:
1. Navigate to the World Building tab
2. Click "Characters" in the sidebar
3. Click the "+" button to create a new character
4. Fill in the character details and click "Save"

Characters can be NPCs or important historical figures. For player characters, it's recommended to use the PC section in Campaign Planning.

**Note:** You can delete a character by right-clicking on it in the directory.

### Locations

Locations are the places in your world, from continents and countries down to individual buildings or rooms. 

To create a location:
1. Navigate to the World Building tab
2. Click "Locations" in the sidebar
3. Click the "+" button to create a new location
4. Fill in the location details and click "Save"

Locations can be organized hierarchically (e.g., a city within a country within a continent) and can be linked to one or more Foundry Scenes.

**Note:** The right-click menu for Locations includes deleting the location, as well as adding a child.  If you have AI features enabled, it also includes AI generation of a new child location.

### Organizations

Organizations represent groups of characters with a common purpose, such as governments, religions, guilds, or families.

To create an organization:
1. Navigate to the World Building tab
2. Click "Organizations" in the sidebar
3. Click the "+" button to create a new organization
4. Fill in the organization details and click "Save"

Like locations, organizations can be organized hierarchically.

**Note:** The right-click menu for Organizations includes deleting the organization, as well as adding a child.  If you have AI features enabled, it also includes AI generation of a new child organization.

### Events

Events represent significant occurrences in your world's history or future.

To create an event:
1. Navigate to the World Building tab
2. Click "Events" in the sidebar
3. Click the "+" button to create a new event
4. Fill in the event details and click "Save"

**Note:** You can delete a character by right-clicking on it in the directory.

### Species

You can have a list of species (only one - not one per world).  This list is used to populate the species drop-down
for characters.  If you are using AI generation, the description of the species is also used there to help refine character 
suggestions and images.

To define a species:
1. Navigate to the Settings menu
2. Select "Species List"
3. Click "Add Species"
4. Fill in the species details and click "Save"

### Hierarchies

Both locations and organizations can be organized into hierarchies. This makes it easy to navigate your world and understand relationships between elements.

To create a hierarchy:
1. When creating or editing a location or organization, you can select a parent from the dropdown menu
2. The element will be placed as a child of the selected parent
3. You can view the full hierarchy in the directory
