[^Topic]: A category that organizes related Entries. There are three Topics: Characters, Locations, and Organizations.
[^Type]: A user-defined categorization of Entries to assist in finding Entries within a Topic. For example, Characters might have Types such as NPC, PC, Monster, etc.; Locations could have Types such as City, Town, Dungeon, Ruin, etc.  They can be shown in the Setting tree, and are used to facilitate search and AI character description/image creation.
[^Vignettes]: Called "Scenes" by The Lazy DM, a framework of potential elements that can be used to build a session. They are not necessarily a fixed, linear script but rather a collection of ideas, encounters, or plot points that can be woven together depending on player actions and the flow of the game.
