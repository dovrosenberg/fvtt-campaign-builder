## Introduction

The goal of this package is to facilitate creating, planning, and running campaigns in Foundry. It combines the world-building and lore creation of tools like WorldAnvil, Kanka, Fantasia Archive, LegendKeeper, etc. with a framework for organizing your campaigns and sessions (built off of the Lazy DM approach, but able to use used with any style of prep).
