# Foundry Campaign Builder (a world & campaign builder for Foundry VTT)

*Note: The instructions are still a bit of a work in progress.  I think everything here is correct, but there are likely things missing and things may not be in the most obvious place.  Suggested edits or PRs for edits welcome.*

## Introduction
The goal of this package is to facilitate creating, planning, and running campaigns in Foundry.  It combines the world-building and lore creation of tools like WorldAnvil, Kanka, Fantasia Archive, LegendKeeper, etc. with a framework for organizing your campaigns and sessions (built off of the Lazy DM approach, but able to use used with any style of prep).

See the [official description](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-campaign-builder) for a longer summary of features and functionality.

## Important note on players vs GM
The module currently only works for the GM.  Players may see some settings available, but they won't do anything and there is no way to open the main window without having GM permission.

I intend to change that at some point - in particular creating ways for everyone to contribute to the worldbuilding and for the GM to selectively share pieces of world information/lore with players.  But for now, GM only.

## Terminology
[TODO - explain "directory", "entry", "world", etc.  Probably move the section from the main description here?]
