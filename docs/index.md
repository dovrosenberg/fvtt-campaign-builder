# Foundry Campaign Builder (a world & campaign builder for Foundry VTT)

*Note: The instructions are still a bit of a work in progress.  I think everything here is correct, but there are likely things missing and things may not be in the most obvious place.  Suggested edits or PRs for edits welcome.*

## Introduction
The goal of this package is to facilitate creating, planning, and running campaigns in Foundry.  It combines the world-building and lore creation of tools like WorldAnvil, Kanka, Fantasia Archive, LegendKeeper, etc. with a framework for organizing your campaigns and sessions (built off of the Lazy DM approach, but able to use used with any style of prep).

The module has three primary components:
- **World Building**: Create and manage your world's lore, characters, locations, and more
- **Campaign Planning**: Plan and organize your next session using the Lazy DM method
- **Playing a Session**: Tools to run your game session more easily, while seamlessly collecting notes to be able to capture what happened and begin your prep for the next session

See the [official description](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-campaign-builder) for a longer summary of features and functionality.

## Advanced features
You'll see features throughout this documentation labeled "[Advanced]".  These features require the setup and configuration described under [Advanced Features](advanced-features.html) to make them available.

## GM-only, for now
The module currently only works for the GM.  Players may see some settings available, but they won't do anything and there is no way to open the main window without having GM permission.

I intend to change that at some point - in particular creating ways for everyone to contribute to the worldbuilding and for the GM to selectively share pieces of world information/lore with players.  But for now, GM only.

## Terminology
This documentation uses several specific terms related to the World & Campaign Builder (though many are commonly used in TTRPG, as well). Hover over highlighted terms to see their definitions:

- World: The fictional setting where your Campaigns take place
- Entry: A document containing information about a specific element of your world (ex. a Character or Location)
- Topic: A category that organizes related Entries. There are four Topics: *Characters*, *Locations*, and *Organizations*
- Type: [TODO]
- Campaign: A collection of Sessions played by the same (or generally the same) group of players.  It is primarily just for grouping Sessions together.
- Session: A single play session.  When running in "Play Mode" [TODO:Link], the most recent Session is enabled with additional functionality.
