# 🧙‍♂️ 404: The Page Has Vanished!

> *You cast `Locate Page`… but the spell fizzles. The scroll crumbles. A squirrel laughs at you.*

The link you followed has disappeared into the ethereal plane. Perhaps it:

- Was devoured by a mimic.
- Was teleported by a wild magic surge.
- Never existed. (Roll an Investigation check… Nat 1.)
