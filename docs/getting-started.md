# Getting Started

After installation and activation, you'll find a new button with a globe icon to the left of your scene selection dropdown in the top left corner of your Foundry screen. Clicking this button opens the main interface.

## Your first world
When you first open the module, you'll be prompted to create your first world. Almost everything that happens in Campaign Builder is inside of a world. These "FCB Worlds" are separate from your Foundry world. Yes, it's confusing.  You can have multiple FCB worlds inside one Foundry world/game.  All of your characters, locations, and campaign information reside within a single FCB world and can't cross over between them.  As you'll see later, you can have more than one campaign in a given world, and they can share all of the same characters, locations, etc.

Note that there's currently no way to move a worlds between Foundry worlds/games.  If you have a use case for that, let's talk.

## Where's all this stored?
For the curious, each World has it's own folder in your compendia (in a top-level folder called 'Campaign Builder').  Inside the world folder is a compendium for the world.  All of the module's data is stored in Journal Entries inside this compendium.  Don't mess with it if you want everything to keep working.
