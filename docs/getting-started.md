# Getting Started

After installation and activation, you'll find a new button with a globe icon to the left of your scene selection dropdown. Clicking this button opens the main interface.

The module has three primary components:
- **World Building**: Create and manage your world's lore, characters, locations, and more
- **Campaign Planning**: Plan and organize your sessions using the Lazy DM method
- **Playing a Session**: Tools to run your game session more easily, while seamlessly collecting notes to be able to capture what happened and begin your prep for the next session

## Your first world

When you first open the module, you'll be prompted to create your first world. Almost everything that happens in FCB is inside of a world. You can have multiple FCB worlds inside one Foundry world/game, but all of your characters, locations, and campaign information reside within a single FCB world and can't cross over.
