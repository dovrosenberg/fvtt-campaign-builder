# Workflows and Tasks

The Campaign Builder is designed around four main workflow categories that support the full lifecycle of tabletop RPG campaign management. Each workflow focuses on specific tasks and activities that help you create engaging campaigns and run successful sessions.

## Main Workflow Categories

### [World Building](world-building/)
Build and organize your campaign setting with interconnected locations, characters, and organizations.

- [Creating Your Campaign World](world-building/campaign-world.md)
- [Building Locations and Settings](world-building/locations.md)
- [Developing Characters and NPCs](world-building/characters.md)
- [Establishing Organizations and Factions](world-building/organizations.md)
- [Organizing World Content](world-building/organizing-content.md)

### [Campaign Planning](campaign-planning/)
Structure your campaign with arcs, storylines, and resource management.

- [Structuring Your Campaign](campaign-planning/campaign-structure.md)
- [Planning Individual Sessions](campaign-planning/session-planning.md)
- [Managing Campaign Content and Resources](campaign-planning/content-management.md)

### [Session Preparation](session-prep/)
Prepare effectively for upcoming sessions using proven methods.

- [Session Preparation Overview](session-prep/index.md)
- [The Lazy DM Method](session-prep/index.md#the-lazy-dm-method)
- [Creating Session Content](session-prep/index.md#creating-a-new-session)
- [Pre-Session Checklist](session-prep/checklist.md)

### [Playing a Session](session-play/)
Tools and techniques for running engaging sessions and managing content during gameplay.

- [Running Your Session](session-play/index.md)
- [Managing Content During Gameplay](session-play/gameplay-management.md)
- [Tracking Session Progress](session-play/progress-tracking.md)
- [Real-Time Content Creation](session-play/realtime-content.md)
- [Post-Session Activities](session-play/post-session.md)

## Workflow Integration

These workflows are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. **World Building** provides the foundation of locations, characters, and organizations
2. **Campaign Planning** structures how these elements work together in your story
3. **Session Preparation** helps you prepare specific content for each session
4. **Playing a Session** gives you tools to run the session and capture what happens

Each workflow can be used independently, but they're most powerful when used together as part of your overall campaign management process.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the Campaign Builder, we recommend starting with:

1. [World Building](world-building/) - Create your basic setting and key NPCs
2. [Campaign Planning](campaign-planning/) - Structure your first few sessions
3. [Session Preparation](session-prep/) - Prepare for your first session
4. [Playing a Session](session-play/) - Run your session with the tools provided
