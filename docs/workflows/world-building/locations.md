# Building Locations and Settings

Locations are the physical spaces where your adventures unfold. The Campaign Builder helps you create detailed, interconnected locations that bring your world to life and provide rich environments for storytelling.

## Understanding Locations

### What Are Locations?
Locations in the Campaign Builder represent any physical place in your world:

- **Settlements**: Cities, towns, villages, camps
- **Buildings**: Taverns, shops, temples, castles
- **Natural Features**: Mountains, forests, rivers, caves
- **Regions**: Kingdoms, provinces, wilderness areas
- **Structures**: Bridges, ruins, monuments, dungeons

### Location Hierarchy
Locations can be organized in parent-child relationships to represent geographical containment:

```
Kingdom of Aldoria (Region)
├── Capital City of Goldenhaven (Settlement)
│   ├── The Royal District (District)
│   │   ├── The Royal Palace (Building)
│   │   └── The Grand Cathedral (Building)
│   ├── The Merchant Quarter (District)
│   │   ├── The Golden Goblet Inn (Building)
│   │   └── Thurgan's Smithy (Building)
│   └── The Docks District (District)
├── Village of Millbrook (Settlement)
└── The Whispering Woods (Wilderness)
    └── The Ancient Grove (Natural Feature)
```
