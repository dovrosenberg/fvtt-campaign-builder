# Playing a Session

The module provides several features to help you run your game smoothly.

## Session Management

During a session:
1. Open the Campaign Planning tab
2. Select the current session
3. Use the various tabs to access your prepared content
4. Mark elements as "used" or "revealed" as appropriate

## Quick Access

The module provides quick access to:
- Foundry Scenes linked to your Locations
- Foundry Actors linked to your Characters
- Foundry Items linked to your magic items

Simply click the appropriate icon next to an element to access it. Context menus are also available for additional options.

## Note Taking

You can take notes during the session:
1. In your session, click the "Notes" tab
2. Enter your notes
3. Click "Save"

Entering play mode will (assuming you have the setting turned on in Module Settings) automatically open a separate window
that is tied to the notes of the current session.  This can make it easier to take quick notes without needing to change your tab, etc.
inside the main window.  

Changes in one spot will be reflected in the other when you save.
