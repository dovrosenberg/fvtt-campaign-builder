# Campaign Planning

Campaign planning transforms your world building efforts into structured narratives and engaging storylines. The Campaign Builder helps you organize campaign arcs, plan individual sessions, and manage the long-term progression of your campaign.

## Overview

Campaign planning bridges the gap between your static world content and the dynamic experiences your players will have. It focuses on structure, pacing, and progression to create compelling narratives that unfold over multiple sessions.

## Campaign Planning vs. Other Workflows

Understanding how campaign planning fits with other workflows:

**World Building** provides the foundation:
- Locations, characters, and organizations become building blocks
- Static world elements provide narrative potential
- Relationships and conflicts create story opportunities

**Campaign Planning** adds structure and direction:
- Transforms world elements into storylines
- Creates progression and pacing
- Plans character development and world evolution

**Session Preparation** implements campaign plans:
- Uses campaign structure to prepare specific sessions
- Focuses campaign elements into immediate content
- Adapts plans based on player choices

**Playing Sessions** brings plans to life:
- Executes prepared content during gameplay
- Captures player choices that affect campaign direction
- Generates outcomes that feed back into campaign planning

## Core Campaign Planning Elements

### Campaign Structure
The Campaign Builder organizes campaigns hierarchically:

```
Campaign

│   ├── Session 1
│   ├── Session 2
│   └── Session 3
├── Campaign Arc 2
│   ├── Session 4
│   ├── Session 5
│   └── Session 6
└── Campaign Arc 3
    └── ...
```
