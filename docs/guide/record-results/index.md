# Recording Play Results

this is when you go through what happened, merge new information into your world, and prepare for the next session.






## Record the results {#record-results}
* Go through vignettes, lore and see which were used; delete or move unused ones to the next session with a click
* Add any new locations, NPCs, etc. to the world - you can do this while playing but it may be easier to just take quick notes and do it afterwards 
* Add anything that's top of mind to the next session to get started for next time

# Post-Session

[TODO]
After a session, you can:
1. Review which Vignettes and lore were used
2. Move unused elements to the next session with a click
3. Add any new Locations, NPCs, etc. to your Setting
4. Create a new session for next time and add any initial thoughts



# Record Play Results

The Campaign Builder helps you prepare for your sessions using the [Lazy DM method](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_dungeon_master_cc.html), a streamlined approach to session preparation that focuses on the essential elements needed to run an engaging game. This guide will walk you through preparing your sessions effectively.  If you prefer to use a different approach to your session prep, I suspect the same structure can be used.  File a feature request if you have ideas for something that's missing for your style.

## Creating a New Session

To create a new session:
1. Right-click on your campaign in the Campaign Directory (bottom section of the directory)
2. Select "Create Session"
3. Give your session a name and number
4. You can also note the session's date

Each session must have a unique number within a campaign. Sessions are sorted by number in the campaign directory, and the most recent session date determines the "current session" when in Play mode.  There is a setting [TODO: link to setting] that will instead sort it by date or name.

The name is required, but it could be "Sesson 4" or something.  If you name your sessions after you're done, you can also just call the current one "TBD" until you give it a name.

## The Lazy DM Method

The [Lazy DM] method focuses on preparing these key elements for each session:

### 1. Strong Start
A compelling opening scene that immediately draws players into the action. This could be:
- An exciting combat encounter
- A dramatic social situation
- A mysterious discovery
- A time-sensitive problem

To add a Strong Start:
1. In your session, click the "Strong Start" tab

2. Enter your strong start description

3. Click "Save"

### 2. Vignettes (i.e. Scenes)
Potential scenes that might occur during your session. Lazy DM calls them scenes, but we call them "vignettes" to avoid confusion with Foundry scenes.

To add a vignette:
1. In your session, click the "Vignettes" tab

2. Click "Add Vignette"

3. Fill in the free-form description.  Hit enter to save.

You can edit vignettes by clicking the description or the edit button.

### 3. Lore (i.e. Secrets and Clues)
Information that players might discover during the session. This helps create a sense of discovery and progression.  Lazy DM calls these "secrets and clues" but we call them "Lore" because a) it's simpler, and b) we have a mechanism [TODO: link] to track Lore on the campaign - not just the session.  And that means you might want to keeps things there that aren't exactly secrets or clues.

To add lore:
1. In your session, click the "Lore" tab

2. Click "Add Lore"

3. Fill in the lore details and hit enter to save.

Alternately, you can start by dragging a journal entry page (not a full entry) on to the drop box on the lore tab.  This will create a new lore entry already linked to it.

You can drag journal entry pages to existing rows to attach them.  You cannot currently remove a journal entry page from a lore entry.  Instead, just create a new one and then copy/paste the lore description.

### 4. Locations
Key places that might be relevant to the upcoming session.  Locations are tied to Locations in your Setting.  [TODO: link to location page or something?]

To add a Location:
1. In your session, click the "Locations" tab

2. Click "Add Location"

3. Select a Location from your Setting

Alternately, drag/drop a location from the [^Setting Directory] to the drop box to add it to the session.

You can click on the name or parent (if applicable) to open those locations in the tab.

You can also create a new location right from the session screen by clicking "Create Location" in the add location box.

[TODO: pic]

### 5. NPCs
Characters that might appear in the upcoming session.  NPCs are tied to Characters in your Setting.  [TODO: link to character page or something?]

To add an NPC:
1. In your session, click the "NPCs" tab

2. Click "Add NPC"

3. Select a Character from your Setting

Alternately, drag/drop a character from the [^Setting Directory] to the drop box to add it to the session.

You can click on the name to open the character in the tab.

You can also create a new NPC right from the session screen by clicking "Create Character" in the add character box.

[TODO: pic]

### 6. Monsters
Creatures that players might encounter during the session.  Monsters are tied to Foundry actors.

To add a monster:
1. In your session, click the "Monsters" tab

2. Click "Add monster"

3. Select an actor (this list currently only includes actors in the world - not in compendia)

Alternately, drag/drop an actor from elsewhere in Foundry to the drop box to add it to the session.

You can click on the number cell or the edit button to change the number of monsters you're thinking about using.  Press enter to save.

You can use the drag grabber (TODO: pic) to drag the monster onto the current scene.  Simply click on it, then drag to where you want the token to go.  This works exactly like dragging an actor from the Foundry toolbar and makes it easy __________________

### 7. Magic Items
Treasures that might appear during the session.

To add a magic item:
1. In your session, click the "Magic Items" tab

2. Drag an item from somewhere else in Foundry onto the list

## Delivering and moving items  [TODO: move this to the wrap up section?]  Then link to it above if needed
Many of the items above have notations in their tables that they can be 'moved to the next session' or 'delivered', or in the case of lore 'moved to the campaign' (TODO: right?).  Here is what that means and why you might want to do it:

- Move to next session: Remove this item from the current session and add it to the list on the next one.  Useful for easily carrying over 

## Session Wrap-up

After each session:
1. Review the to-do list for anything that needs attention

2. Look through all session tabs for unused elements:
   - Delete elements that are no longer relevant
   - Move elements to the next session if they might be useful
   - For lore, you can move it back to the campaign lore list if you want to keep it for later

## Tips for Effective Session Prep

1. **Start with the Strong Start**: Begin your prep by crafting an engaging opening scene

2. **Prepare 3-5 Vignettes**: This gives you enough material to work with while staying flexible

3. **Create 5-7 Secrets/Clues**: This provides enough discovery opportunities without overwhelming prep

4. **Keep NPCs and Locations Connected**: Link your NPCs to locations and other NPCs to create a living world

5. **Prepare More Monsters Than You Need**: This gives you flexibility during the session

6. **Use the To-Do List**: Track what needs attention between sessions

7. **Review Previous Sessions**: Look at what worked and what didn't to improve future prep

## Play Mode

When you're ready to run the session:
1. Switch to Play mode using the toggle in the Campaign Builder window

2. A session notes popup will appear for taking notes during play

3. Use the various tabs to access your prepared content

4. Mark elements as "used" or "revealed" as you go

5. Take notes in the session notes window

Changes made during play are tracked in the to-do list, helping you follow up on important developments after the session.
