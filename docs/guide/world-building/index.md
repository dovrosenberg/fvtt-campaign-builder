# World Building

World building is the foundation of your campaign. The Campaign Builder helps you create and organize your campaign world with interconnected [^Locations], [^Characters], and [^Organizations] that bring your [^Settings] to life.

World building in the Campaign Builder focuses on creating reusable content that forms the backbone of your campaign. Unlike [^Session]-specific preparation, world building content is designed to be referenced and expanded throughout your entire campaign.

## Core concepts
* [Create](/reference/world-building/) Characters, Locations, and Organizations
* Easily see (and click through) the [relationships](/reference/world-building/content/entry/relationships) between them
* Locations and Organizations exist in [hierarchies](/reference/navigation/sidebar/#hierarchies)
* Use AI to [generate](/reference/world-building/content/entry/generate) detailed descriptions and images [[Advanced Feature]]

## Core World Building Components
* [Setting Directory](/reference/navigation/sidebar#setting-directory)
* [Entry Display](/reference/world-building/content/entry)

<!-- ### Settings Directory
The Settings Directory is your central hub for all world content. It organizes your world into several key categories:

- **Locations**: Physical places in your world
- **Characters**: NPCs and important figures
- **Organizations**: Factions, guilds, governments, and other groups

### Content Relationships
One of the key strengths of the Campaign Builder is how world content interconnects:

- Characters can be associated with locations and organizations
- Locations can have parent-child relationships (city > district > building)
- Organizations can have members, allies, and rivals
- All content can be linked through custom relationships

## Getting Started with World Building

If you're just starting your world building process:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a single location (like a town or city) rather than trying to map an entire world
2. **Focus on the Immediate**: Create content for places and people your players will encounter soon
3. **Build Connections**: Even with limited content, establish relationships between locations, characters, and organizations
4. **Expand Organically**: Add new content as your campaign grows and players explore

## World Building vs. Session Content

Understanding the difference between world building and session preparation is key:

**World Content** (Settings Directory):
- Persistent across all sessions
- Foundational elements of your campaign
- Designed for reuse and reference
- Examples: The Tavern, Mayor Johnson, The Thieves' Guild

**Session Content** (Campaign Directory):
- Specific to individual sessions
- Temporary or one-time elements
- Prepared for immediate use
- Examples: "The mayor needs help with bandits", "Clue about the thieves' meeting"

## Tips for Effective World Building

### Keep it Flexible
- Don't over-prepare areas players may never visit
- Leave room for improvisation and player-driven content
- Be ready to adapt your world based on player interests

### Use Templates and Patterns
- Develop templates for similar content types (taverns, shops, guard posts)
- Establish naming conventions for consistency
- Create standard organizational structures

### Connect Everything
- Every location should have at least one associated character
- Every character should have motivations and connections
- Every organization should have goals and relationships

### Reference Real-World Inspiration
- Draw inspiration from historical periods, cultures, and locations
- Adapt real-world conflicts and political structures
- Use familiar archetypes as starting points, then make them unique

## Integration with Other Workflows

World building content seamlessly integrates with other Campaign Builder workflows:

- **Campaign Planning**: Use world content as building blocks for your campaign arcs
- **Session Preparation**: Reference world content when preparing for specific sessions
- **Playing Sessions**: Quick access to world content during gameplay

Your world building efforts create a living foundation that supports all other aspects of your campaign management.  -->
