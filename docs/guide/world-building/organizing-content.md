# Organizing World Content

Effective organization of your world content is essential for creating a cohesive, accessible, and maintainable campaign Setting. This guide covers best practices for structuring, linking, and managing your world building elements.

## Organization Principles

### Hierarchy and Structure
Organize content in logical hierarchies that reflect real-world relationships:

**Geographic Hierarchy**
```
World/Plane
├── Continent/Region
│   ├── Kingdom/Nation
│   │   ├── Province/State
│   │   │   ├── City/Town
│   │   │   │   ├── District/Quarter
│   │   │   │   │   └── Building/Location
```

**Organizational Hierarchy**
```
Empire/Kingdom
├── Government Departments
│   ├── Regional Administrations
│   │   ├── Local Offices
│   │   │   └── Individual Officials
```

**Social Hierarchy**
```
Social Class/Caste
├── Family/House
│   ├── Branch Families
│   │   ├── Individual Members
│   │   │   └── Personal Relationships
```

### Interconnectedness
Build webs of relationships between elements:
