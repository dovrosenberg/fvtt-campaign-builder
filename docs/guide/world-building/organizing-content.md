# Organizing World Content

Effective organization of your world content is essential for creating a cohesive, accessible, and maintainable campaign [^Setting]. This guide covers best practices for structuring, linking, and managing your world building elements.

## Options for organization
There are four ways in which elements can be organized within your Setting:
* [Parent/child relationships](#hierarchy)
* [Types](#types)
* [Tags](#tags)
* [Related entries](#relationships)

They are designed to be flexible, so understanding them all will let you decide how you want to approach it for your use.

## Parent/child relationships {#hierarchy}
Parent/child relationships are visualized in the [^Setting Directory] and are used to organize content in logical hierarchies that reflect real-world relationships.  They apply to Locations and Organizations.  

![Sample location hierarchy](/assets/images/sample-location-hierarchy.webp)

Arranging your hierarchy allows you to quickly find related entries.  If you keep open the Entry that your players are currently in during the session, you can instantly see in the tree, all the details about where it fits in the world (parents), as well as places they are likely to go next (siblings or children).

You can setup your hierarchy by [DRAG/DROP IN THE TREE](TODO) or [SETTING THE PARENT FIELD]
----------------
TODO: move this to right place
You put [^Entries] in a hierarchy by either setting the Parent field on an Entry or dragging an Entry (the child) onto another one (the parent) in the [^Setting Directory] tree.

Also note there that there how hierarchy impacts search - or maybe in the search section and reference it from here and there
------------------

Some possible ways you might organize your Entries with parent/child relationships.

## Related Entries {#relationships}
Any Entry can have a relationship with any other.  These can represent a wide variety of types of connectedness:
* Connect two Characters who are related, or two who are enemies
* Connect the Mayor (Character) to her city (Location)
* List the Characters who sit on a guild's council (an Organization that might itself be the child of another Organization representing the overall guild)
* Describe the Locations where a cult (Organization) is operating

Some types of relationships (Character-Location and Character-Organization) also let you specify the "Role" that the character plays in the related Entry (ex. the "Mayor" of a city).

See ________________ for how to create a relationship.


-------------------------
TODO: MOVE THIS TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN REFERENC
You create these by going to the "Related Entry" tabs on any Entry and either clicking "Add Location" (or Organization/Character) or dragging the Entry to link from the tree into the dashed box.

Also note there that the role is searchable - or maybe in the search section and reference it from here and there

## Relationship Management

### Direct Relationships
Track explicit connections between elements:

**Character-Location Relationships**
- Lives at, Works at, Owns, Visits regularly
- Born in, Grew up in, Exiled from, Dreams of returning to
- Rules, Protects, Threatens, Loves, Hates

**Character-Character Relationships**
- Family: Parent, Child, Sibling, Spouse, Cousin
- Professional: Employer, Employee, Colleague, Competitor
- Social: Friend, Enemy, Rival, Mentor, Student, Lover

**Character-Organization Relationships**

**Organization-Organization Relationships**
- Allies, Enemies, Rivals, Subsidiaries, Parent organizations
- Cooperates with, Competes against, Infiltrates, Supports

### Indirect Relationships
Consider implied connections and second-degree relationships:

**Network Effects**
- Friends of friends become acquaintances
- Enemy's ally becomes potential threat
- Geographic proximity creates awareness
- Shared organization membership creates bonds

**Inference Opportunities**
- Characters living in same location likely know each other
- Organizations with similar goals might cooperate or compete
- Historical events create lasting relationships
- Economic dependencies create ongoing connections

### Relationship Documentation
Track relationships systematically:

**Primary Relationships**
- Core connections central to character or element identity
- Strong emotional or practical bonds
- Frequently referenced or important to plots
- Define character motivations and behaviors

**Secondary Relationships**
- Useful connections for specific situations
- Professional or casual social bonds
- Potential for development into primary relationships
- Background elements that add depth

**Historical Relationships**
- Past connections that may be renewed
- Changed relationships that create complexity
- Family histories and generational conflicts
- Organizational evolution and transformation

## Scalability Planning

### Growth Management
Design systems that can expand gracefully:
