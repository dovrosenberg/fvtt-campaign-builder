# Creating Your Campaign World

Your campaign world is the stage where all your adventures take place. The Campaign Builder helps you establish the foundational elements that will define your Setting and provide the backdrop for memorable stories.

## Starting Your World

### Choose Your Scale
Before diving into details, decide on the scope of your initial world building:

**Small Scale (Recommended for new campaigns)**
- A single town or city and its immediate surroundings
- 3-5 key locations within the settlement
- 5-10 important NPCs
- 2-3 local organizations or factions

**Medium Scale**
- A region containing multiple settlements
- Major trade routes and geographical features
- Regional powers and their relationships
- Cross-settlement connections and conflicts

**Large Scale**
- Multiple kingdoms, nations, or planes
- Continental or global politics
- Ancient histories and world-spanning threats
- Complex webs of alliances and conflicts

> **Tip**: Start small and expand. It's easier to add detail to a well-developed small area than to manage a vast but shallow world.

## Foundational Elements

Your world's tone affects every aspect of content creation:
