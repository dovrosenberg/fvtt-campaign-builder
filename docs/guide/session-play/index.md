# Playing a Session
Time for the fun!  Campaign Builder has a variety of tools and techniques to run your sessions more efficiently, while capturing what's happening in the session for easy reference [later](/guide/record-results).

## Core concepts
* Turn on "Play Mode" using the [Prep/Play Toggle](/reference/navigation/prep-play)
* Keep [notes](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/notes) of what's happening while bringing in the elements you've defined; use the [Session Notes Popup](/reference/play-mode/session-note-popup) to have easy access to notes regardless of where you are in Campaign Builder
* Mark off [^Vignettes], [^Lore], etc. as being [^delivered]as they come up
* Bring up the full world-building details of your [^Locations] and [^Characters]
  * Click on the ones you knew would come up from the [Locations](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/locations) and [NPCs](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/npcs) tabs
  * Use the [hierarchy](/reference/navigation/sidebar#hierarchies) to see all the other nearby locations    (quick - what's the name of that store they came to in this town last time?) 
  * Use [related entry lists](/reference/world-building/content/entry/relationships) (what was the Mayor's sister's name?) to have easy access to the mostly likely topics to come up in that location or while interacting with the NPC
* [Activate](/reference/world-building/content/location#scenes) the Foundry scenes for a location with a single click; drag [Monsters](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/monsters) right from the Session prep to the canvas
* [Grant](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/magic-items) magic items to players by dragging to actors from your session prep
* Instantly [generate](/reference/play-mode/name-generation) names for NPCs, towns, shops, and taverns [[Advanced Feature]]. With another click, add them to your world for future reference.
* Quickly [navigate](/reference/play-mode/session-links) back to any Session prep tab with a single click from any other place in the UI

## Core Session Play Components
* [Prep/Play Toggle](/reference/navigation/prep-play)
* [Session Notes](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/session/notes)
* [Name-Generation Buttons](/reference/play-mode/name-generation)
* [Session Links](/reference/play-mode/session-links)
* [Campaign To-do List](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/campaign/todos)


<!-- # Playing a Session

The module provides several features to help you run your game smoothly.

## Session Management

During a session:
1. Open the Campaign Planning tab

2. Select the current session

3. Use the various tabs to access your prepared content

4. Mark elements as "used" or "revealed" as appropriate

## Quick Access

The module provides quick access to:
- Foundry Scenes linked to your Locations
- Foundry Actors linked to your Characters
- Foundry Items linked to your magic items

Simply click the appropriate icon next to an element to access it. Context menus are also available for additional options.

## Note Taking

You can take notes during the session:
1. In your session, click the "Notes" tab

2. Enter your notes

3. Click "Save"

Entering play mode will (assuming you have the setting turned on in Module Settings) automatically open a separate window
that is tied to the notes of the current session.  This can make it easier to take quick notes without needing to change your tab, etc.
inside the main window.  

Changes in one spot will be reflected in the other when you save. -->
