## Where's all this stored?
For the curious, each Setting has its own folder in your compendia (inside a top-level folder called 'Campaign Builder').  Inside the Setting folder is a compendium for the Setting.  All of the module's data is stored in Journal Entries inside this compendium.  *Don't mess with it if you want everything to keep working.*
