# World-Building Interface (Settings)

The [Setting Directory] is your primary workspace for creating and managing world-building content. All of the [^Entries] in your [^Settings] are here, making for easy visualization and navigation.

One key principle is that while you can have multiple Settings in the same Foundry world, you can only work inside one Setting at a time.
Various elements in the directory will bring up detailed displays when clicked:
* [Setting Details](./content/setting)
* [Entry Details](./content/entry)
    * [Character Details](./content/character)
    * [Location Specifics](./content/location)
    * [Organization Details](./content/organization)
