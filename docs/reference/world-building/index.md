# World-Building (Settings) Overview

The [Setting Directory] is your primary workspace for creating and managing world-building content. All of the [^Entries] in your [^Settings] are here, making for easy visualization and navigation.

Various elements in the directory will bring up detailed displays when clicked:
* [Setting Details](./content/setting) - Description of the Setting and configuration of Settings-specific options
* [Entry Details](./content/entry) - Flesh out the details of your world
    * [Character Details](./content/character)
    * [Location Specifics](./content/location)
    * [Organization Details](./content/organization)
