# Setting Window
[TODO: pic]

The Setting window has just a few key components.

## Setting header
The Setting header has just two parts:
  1. Name - This is where you edit the Setting's name.
  2. Generate Button - This gives access to Setting-specific configuration, specifically [Name Styles](./namestyles)

## Setting description tab
The description tab has four components:
1. Image
2. Genre
3. Setting Feeling
4. Description text area

## Image
See [Image] documentation.

## Genre
The Genre is where you capture the high-level type of your Setting.  Typical examples would be "Fantasy" or "Sci-Fi".  These are used for [Advanced Features] to ensure generated content fits your theme.

## Setting Feeling
Similar to Genre, this field allows you to give a more detailed description.  For example, "A dark and rugged world where only the strong survive" or "A light, playful world with humor around every corner". This description is used for [Advanced Features] to further refine generated content.

## Description text area
This is where you can provide a detailed description of the Setting and high-level lore.  What's the history? What does the pantheon look like? How many explored planetary systems are there? 

In the future, this description may be made available to players as starting background, but for now it's just for your use.
