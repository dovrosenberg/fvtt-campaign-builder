# Name Styles [[Advanced Feature]]
![Name Styles](/assets/images/namestyles.webp)

The Name Styles dialog allows you to determine the type of names that will be generated for characters and locations.  This applies to both generation when creating/updating [^Entries] as well as the names in the automatic [RollTables](/reference/playing/rolltables).

There are two sections to the dialog:

## Sample Names
The top section of the dialog shows a list of sample names for each style, based on the [^Setting] genre and feeling.  If you want to get more specific, you might try including in the world feeling detail

> [!INFO]
> If you have updated the ^Setting genre or feeling since last opening this dialog, it may take a bit to generate the new samples. 

## Checkboxes
Simply check the boxes to enable the name styles you want to use.  Names will be generated randomly from across the selected styles.
