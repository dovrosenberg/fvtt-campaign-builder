# Campaign Description Tab
![Description tab](/assets/images/campaign-content.webp)

The Description tab is the main overview area for your campaign and contains:

## Campaign Image
[TODO: description of how to set/change campaign image]

## Campaign Description
A place where you can enter the main description of your campaign. This might include:
- Campaign premise and themes
- Major story arcs
- Important background information
- Current campaign status

## House Rules
A separate field specifically for documenting any house rules or modifications you're using in this campaign. This keeps rule variations clearly separated from the main campaign description.
