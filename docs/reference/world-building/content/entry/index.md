# Basic structure of Characters, Locations, and Organizations
![Entry Window](/assets/images/entry-content.webp)

Regardless of Topic, each Entry has a similar layout in the main window.  At the bottom of this description, we'll outline the things that are different.

## Entry header
The Entry header has these main components:
  1. Name - This is where you edit the Entry's name.
  
  2. Push to Session Button (for Characters and Locations) [[Advanced Feature]] - This allows you to add the Character or Location to the [^Current Session] (as an NPC or Location, respectively). If you have more than one campaign with valid sessions, you'll be prompted to select the campaign to push to.

  3. [Generate Button](generate) [[Advanced Feature]] - This gives you the option to generate a description or image for the current entry.

  4. [Tags] - An easy way to categorize entries. Particularly helpful for [searching](/reference/navigation/search). 

## Tabs
There are several tabs on the Entry details screen:
  - [Description tab](./description) - overview information about the Entry
  - [Relationship tabs](./relationships) - show the connections between this entry and others
  - Foundry document tabs: After the Entry relationship tabs, you'll find an [Actors tab](/reference/world-building/content/character#actors) when looking at a Character and a [Scenes tab](/reference/world-building/content/location#scenes) when looking at a Location.  
  - [Sessions tab](./sessions) - a quick way to find game session notes that mention this entry
