# Tags
![Tags](/assets/images/tags.webp)

In the tags input, you can assign tags to your [^Entries].  

Tags allow you to capture key data about Entries to see at a glance.  Tags are given strong preference when [searching](/reference/navigation/search) (the same as name), so they are a powerful way to find your Entries quickly.

## Adding tags
To add a tag, simply start typing. As you type, you'll get an auto-complete showing other tags you've already used.  Tags are assigned a random color, but that color will be the same across all Entries with that tag, making it easy to identify.  

<!-- Tags are Topic-specific.  So, for example, if you are in a Location and another Location has been tagged "Region", then you will see "Region" available as an auto-complete.  If you are in an Organization, you won't see that tag available.  Within a topic, a given tag is assigned a random color, but that color will be the same across all Entries with that tag, making it easy to identify.   -->

## Creating tags
To create a new tag, simply type it in and hit Enter/Tab. It will be assigned a new, random color. 

## Removing tags
When there are no more Entrie using a tag, it will be removed from the list, so it won't be suggested again.
