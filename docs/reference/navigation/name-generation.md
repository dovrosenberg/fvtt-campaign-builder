# Name Generation

The Campaign Builder uses a tabbed interface to help you work with multiple pieces of content simultaneously.

## Opening Tabs
There are several ways to open content in tabs:

**Single Click** (Default behavior)
- Click any entry in the directory sidebar, links within editors, or links in tables 
- Opens content in the current active tab
- Replaces whatever was previously displayed
- You can use the forward/back buttons (see below) to navigate within the tab history 

**Ctrl+Click** (New tab)
- Holding control while clicking any of the items above opens the content in a new tab

**New Tab Button**
- Click the "+" button on the right side of the tab bar
- Creates a blank new tab, with quick links to create new items, search, or access a recent item


## Tab Management

   * **Reordering Tabs**: Drag and drop any tab to reorder the tabs
   * **Closing Tabs**: Click the "X" or use the Alt-W (by default) [keybinding](./keybindings)
   * **Close All Tabs**: Right-click on any tab and choose "Close All Tabs" from the context menu
   * **Close Other Tabs**: Right-click on any tab and choose "Close Other Tabs" to close all tabs except the selected one 

## Tab Navigation

The forward and back buttons on the left side of the [Bookmarks](./bookmarks) can be used to cycle through the history of content displayed in the current tab, just like a browser's forward/back buttons.
