# Main Content Display

The bulk of the main window is the content display.  This is where you can see whatever Entry, etc. you have selected in the sidebar.

## Types of content
There are 4 types of content you can see, and each has its own set of functionality:
- [Settings](/reference/world-building/content/setting)
- [Entries](/reference/world-building/content/entry)
- [Campaigns](/reference/playing/content/campaign)
- [Sessions](/reference/playing/content/session)


## Autocomplete Mentions {#autocomplete-mentions}
There is a separate module - [Autocomplete Mentions](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-autocomplete-mentions) that is not needed but can be highly useful for campaign and world building.  It enables you to type '@' and easily search for the characters, locations, and organizations in your campaign and then insert them as a link in any editor field.  This can be doubly helpful, because (for example) if you insert one of these links in the description of an [^Entry], you will [automatically be asked](TODO: LINK TO THIS SETTING) if you'd like to create a relationship.  So this allows you to connect two entries or mention an entry in a session note (which will then also add it to the campaign [To-do list](/reference/playing/content/campaign/todos)) with just a couple keystrokes.

## Images {#images}

Details on working with the images - I feel like I wrote these somewhere else
