# Bookmarks

Bookmarks provide quick access to frequently used content without cluttering your tab bar. They're essential for maintaining an efficient workflow, especially during active campaign sessions.

## Understanding Bookmarks

### What Are Bookmarks?
Bookmarks are saved shortcuts to specific content that you access regularly:

- **Quick access** to important NPCs, locations, or sessions
- **Persistent shortcuts** that survive closing tabs
- **Organized collections** of related content
- **Session-specific** or **campaign-wide** references

### When to Use Bookmarks
- **Frequently referenced NPCs** (tavern keeper, major antagonist, party allies)
- **Key locations** (home base, important cities, recurring dungeons)
- **Current session content** for easy access during play
- **Important organizations** that drive your campaign
- **Reference materials** you consult regularly
