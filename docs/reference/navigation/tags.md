# Tags
In the tags input, you can assign tags to your entry.  To create a new tag, simply type it in and hit Enter/Tab.  As you type, you'll get an auto-complete showing other tags you've already used.  Tags are Topic-specific.  So, for example, if you are in a Location and another Location has been tagged "Region", then you will see "Region" available as an auto-complete.  If you are in an Organization, you won't see that tag available.  Within a topic, a given tag is assigned a random color, but that color will be the same across all Entries with that tag, making it easy to identify.  Tags are given strong preference when [searching](search) (the same as name), so they are a powerful way to find your entries quickly.
