# Working with Tabs

The Campaign Builder uses a tabbed interface to help you work with multiple pieces of content simultaneously. Understanding how to effectively use tabs will significantly improve your workflow and productivity.

[ note ability to drag to reorder and also drag into campaign tables... put that in campaign section]
[TODO: flesh out... tabs, bookmarks, forward/back, dragging, etc.; maybe the "new tab"]

## Tab Basics

## Tab Workflow Strategies

### Content Development Workflow

   - Edit relationships and references across tabs
   - See immediate updates in all related content

2. **Research and Reference**
   - Keep reference material open in background tabs
   - Compare similar content (e.g., multiple NPCs)
   - Build consistent world elements

### Session Preparation Workflow
1. **Open session content in one tab**
2. **Open relevant world content in other tabs**
   - NPCs appearing in the session
   - Locations where action takes place
   - Organizations involved in plots
3. **Drag content from world tabs to session tab**
4. **Switch between tabs to add details and references**

### Campaign Planning Workflow
1. **Open campaign overview in main tab**
2. **Open individual sessions in separate tabs**
3. **Reference world-building tabs as needed**
4. **Plan connections and continuity across sessions**

## Tab Performance Tips

### Managing Memory Usage
- **Close unused tabs regularly**
- **Avoid keeping too many tabs open simultaneously**
- **Use bookmarks for frequently accessed content**

### Efficient Navigation
- **Use keyboard shortcuts for quick switching**
- **Group related tabs together**
- **Use descriptive names in content for easy tab identification**

### Content Synchronization
- **Changes in one tab update related content immediately**

- **Use this for real-time content development**

## Troubleshooting Tabs

### Common Issues

**Tabs Not Responding**
- Try refreshing the Campaign Builder window
- Close and reopen problematic tabs
- Check if content has been modified and needs saving
