# Playing (Campaign management)

The [Campaign Directory] is your primary workspace for creating and managing content associated with playing your campaign.  This section covers the features associated with using Campaign Builder to prepare for and run your game sessions.

>[!INFO]
> You can have more than one [^Campaign] in the same [^Setting].  These Campaigns share all of the World-Building elements but can have separate PCs and session prep/details.

Various elements in the directory will bring up detailed displays when clicked:
* [Campaign Details](./content/campaign) - Description of the Campaign, associates players, and lists of notes and to-do items
* [Session Details](./content/session) - Used to prepare and play a Session, tracking characters, locations, plot points, etc., as well as the notes from the Session about what happened.
* [PC Details](./content/pc) - Used to keep track of the PCs in your campaign, to give you ideas about new plot points to introduce, etc.
