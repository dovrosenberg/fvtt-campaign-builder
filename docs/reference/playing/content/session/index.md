The Campaign window provides tools for organizing and managing your campaigns within a Setting. Campaigns allow you to group related sessions together, track player characters, maintain campaign-wide lore, capture ideas, and manage tasks. You can define multiple campaigns within a single Setting, which is useful if you use the same Setting across multiple groups who play at different times.

> [!WARNING] [TODO: copy this to the tabs]
> Deleting from Foundry an item that is associated with a Session as a [^Magic Item] or an actor that is associated with a Session as a [^Monster] will completely remove the Magic Item or Monster from the session, even if it had previously been marked as delivered.
