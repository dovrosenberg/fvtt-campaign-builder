# Session Vignettes Tab
![Session Vignettes Tab](/assets/images/vignette-tab.webp)

The Vignettes tab (equivalent to "scenes" in the [Lazy DM] method) allows you to describe basic scenes that may take place during the Session.

This tab provides:

## Adding Vignettes
Click "Add Vignette" to create a new Vignette entry.  Enter the text of the Vignette and hit "Enter" to save.

## The Vignette list
This list contains the individual Vignettes. For each Vignette, you can see its text.

### Vignette Actions
The actions column lets you take several actions with the Vignette entries:
  - **Delete** - Delete the Vignette
  - **Edit** - Opens the Vignette description text box for inline editing. You can also click on the description text to do the same.  Press Enter to save.
  - **Mark as delivered** - Marks the Vignette as having been delivered to the players. If you mark Vignette as delivered while in [^Play Mode], this will add the Vignette item to the Campaign [To-Do List]. 
  - **Move to next session** - This moves the Vignette to the next Session.  You would typically do this after a Session for Vignettes that you didn't deliver but still want to.  If a next Session doesn't exist, it will create one.
