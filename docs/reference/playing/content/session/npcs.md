# Session NPCs Tab
![Session NPCs Tab](/assets/images/npc-tab.webp)

The NPCs tab allows you to list the NPCs that characters are likely to encounter during the Session.  These [^Characters] must be created in the [^Setting], as the list is simply a link to existing Characters.

This tab provides:

## Adding NPCs
Click "Add NPC" to create a new NPC entry.  You will be prompted to search for an existing Character.  Alternately, you can hit "Create Create" to [create](/reference/world-building/create-entry) a new Character from the dialog.

## The NPC list
This list contains the individual NPCs.  For each NPC, you can see its name, [^Type], and a brief selection from its description.

Click the name of the NPC to open the [Character details](/reference/world-building/content/character) page.  Hold control to open in a new tab.

> [!TIP]
> When your players encounter an NPC, click on it to open up the details page, where you can get information for describing it.  From there, you can then use the [Actors tab](/reference/world-building/content/character#actors) to immediately find an associated actors and open their character sheets or drag them right onto the scene in Foundry.
>
> You can also right click on the Characters's image to push it to chat for the players.

### Character Actions
The actions column lets you take several actions with the Character entries:
  - **Delete** - Delete the NPC.  This removes it from the Session list, but DOES NOT delete the Character from the [^Setting].
  - **Mark as delivered** - Marks the NPC as having been delivered to the players. If you mark NPC as delivered while in [^Play Mode], this will add the NPC to the Campaign [To-Do List]. 
  - **Move to next session** - This moves the NPC to the next Session.  You would typically do this after a Session for NPCs that you didn't deliver but think will likely come up next time.  If a next Session doesn't exist, it will create one.
