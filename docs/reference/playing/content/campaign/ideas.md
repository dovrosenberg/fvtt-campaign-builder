# Campaign Ideas Tab
[Campaign Idea tab](/assets/images/idea-tab.webp)

The Ideas tab provides a simple way to capture and organize ideas for your campaign as they come to you.  Perfect for plot hooks you want to explore later, NPCs or locations you want to develo, story complications or twists, player suggestions or interests, and anything else you'd otherwise keep in your email inbox, scraps of paper, or your beautifully illustrated notebook, dpending on your organization style.

## Managing Ideas
Click "Add idea" to create a new idea entry

Click on any idea text (or the edit button) to edit it inline; hit enter to save. 

Delete ideas when they're no longer relevant or have been used

## Email to the list ([Advanced Feature])
In addition to working on the list here, with the use of the backend, you can [setup an email box](/reference//backend) that you can send emails to and have them show up in the ideas list.  A great way for capturing ideas you have at work, while driving (pull over before sending email or use a hands-free assistant), or in the shower (unplug your phone before using in the shower).
