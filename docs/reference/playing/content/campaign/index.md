# Campaign Details

![Campaign content](/assets/images/campaign-content.webp)

The Campaign window houses information pertaining to your overall [^Campaign], as opposed to specific [^Sessions].  This includes notes, house rules, the list of players, lore that you've created but aren't sure when you want to share it, and lists of things you want to try in the future.

## Campaign Header
You can click the campaign's name to edit it.

## Tabs
Campaigns have the following tabs where you can manage their details:
* [Description](./description) - overview information about the Campaign
* [PCs](./pcs) - manage the player characters in the campaign
* [Lore](./lore) - campaign-wide lore
* [Ideas](./ideas) - list of ideas you may want to use in the future
* [To-Dos](./todos) - a list of things you need to do (and in particular, things that happened during a play session that you may want to follow up on)
