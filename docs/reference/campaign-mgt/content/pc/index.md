# PC Details

![PC content](/assets/images/pc-content.webp)

The PC window lets you manage a player character.

## PC Actors

To be useful, a PC needs to be associated with an actor.  You do this by dragging a Foundry actor (ex. from the sidebar) and dropping it on the image area.

You can change the actor by dragging a new one onto the image area.

The name and image of the PC are determined from the actor and updates to those should show on the PC.

## Description
The description section has the following fields:
* Name
* Background Points - good for keeping track of key background on the character you want to review before each session (as opposed to more detailed bios that may exist on the character sheet)
* Other Plot Points - this is where you can track background items that will make for good plot hooks (ex. an enemy)
* Desired Magic Items - keep a list of ideas for future magic items you might want to give the character
