# Campaign Description Tab
![Description tab](/assets/images/campaign-content.webp)

The description tab has is the main overview area for your campaign and contains:
1. Image
2. Campaign description
3. House rules

## Image
See [Image] documentation.

## Campaign Description
A place where you can enter the main description of your campaign. This might include:
- Campaign premise and themes
- Major story arcs
- Important background information
- Current campaign status

Click the orange pencil to start editing, and the save button (or Control-S) to save.

You can drag any [^Entry] from the [Setting Directory] into the description editor, and it will insert a UUID indicator that when you save will be displayed as a clickable link that will open that Entry (hold 'Control' while clicking to open it in a new tab).

It is highly suggested that you check out the [Autocomplete Mentions](/reference/navigation/main-display#autocomplete-mentions) module, which allows you to rapidly reference Foundry documents and Campaign Builder Entries/Sessions/etc. while typing in the editor.  

## House Rules
A separate field specifically for documenting any house rules or modifications you're using in this campaign. This keeps rule variations clearly separated from the main campaign description.  

You may also choose to just put a link to a Foundry journal entry if you want something players can access.
