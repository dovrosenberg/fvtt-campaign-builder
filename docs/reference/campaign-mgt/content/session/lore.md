# Session Lore Tab
![Session Lore Tab](/assets/images/session-lore-tab.webp)

The Lore tab (equivalent to "secrets and clues" in the [Lazy DM] method) allows you to manage pieces of Lore that you might want to deliver to players during the session.

This tab provides:

## Adding Lore
Click "Add Lore" to create a new Lore entry.  Enter the text of the Lore and hit "Enter" to save.

You can drag and drop Journal Entry Pages (not whole journals) from Foundry VTT onto the box at the top to create a linked Lore item or onto an existing Lore item to link it to the journal entry page.  
  
You cannot currently remove a linked entry (i.e. remove the link to the journal entry page) - I recommend just creating a new Lore item and copy/paste the text before removing the old one.

## The Lore list
This list contains the individual pieces of Lore.  For each Lore item, you can see its text and the linked entry.  Click the linked entry (if any) to open the journal entry page.

### Lore Actions
The actions column lets you take several actions with the Lore entries:
  - **Delete** - Delete the Lore
  - **Edit** - Opens the Lore description text box for inline editing. You can also click on the description text to do the same.  Press Enter to save.
  - **Mark as delivered** - Marks the Lore as having been delivered to the players. This will make it show in the "Delivered Lore" list on the [Campaign Lore Tab](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/campaign/Lore).  If you mark Lore as delivered while in [^Play Mode], this will add the Lore item to the Campaign [To-Do List]. 
  - **Move to campaign** - This moves the Lore back to the [Campaign Lore](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/campaign/lore) list.  You would typically do this after a Session for Lore that you want to keep but don't think the next Session will be appropriate.
  - **Move to next session** - This moves the Lore to the next Session.  You would typically do this after a Session for Lore that you didn't deliver but still want to.  If a next Session doesn't exist, it will create one.
