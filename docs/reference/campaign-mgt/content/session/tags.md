# Tags

In the tags input, you can assign tags to your Sessions.  

Tags allow you to capture key data about [^Sessions] to see at a glance.  Tags are given strong preference when [searching](/reference/navigation/search) (the same as name), so they are a powerful way to find your Sessions quickly.

## Adding tags
To add a tag, simply start typing. As you type, you'll get an auto-complete showing other tags you've already used.  A given tag is assigned a random color, but that color will be the same across all Sessions with that tag, making it easy to identify.  

## Creating tags
To create a new tag, simply type it in and hit Enter/Tab. It will be assigned a new, random color. 

## Removing tags
When there are no more Sessions using a tag, it will be removed from the list, so it won't be suggested again.
