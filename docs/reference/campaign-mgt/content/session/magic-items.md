# Session Magic Items Tab
![Session Magic Items Tab](/assets/images/magic-item-tab.webp)

The Magic Items tab allows you to list the Magic Items that characters are likely to encounter during the Session.  A Magic Item is just a reference to an item in Foundry.

This tab provides:

## Adding Magic Items
Click "Add Magic Item" to create a new Magic Item entry.  You will be prompted to search for an existing Foundry item.

> [!Note]
> When searching for an item, it currently only looks in the Foundry world - not in compendiums.  

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting from Foundry an item that is associated with a Session as a Magic Item will completely remove the Magic Item from the Session, even if it had previously been marked as delivered.

## The Magic Item list
This list contains the individual Magic Items.  For each Magic Item, you can see its name.

Click the name of the Magic Item to open the (system-dependent) item description sheet for the actor.

### Magic Item Actions
The actions column lets you take several actions with the Magic Item entries:
  - **Delete** - Delete the Magic Item.  This removes it from the Session list, but DOES NOT delete the Item from Foundry.
  - **Mark as delivered** - Marks the Magic Item as having been delivered to the players. If you mark Magic Item as delivered while in [^Play Mode], this will add the Magic Item to the Campaign [To-Do List]. 
  - **Move to next session** - This moves the Magic Item to the next Session.  You would typically do this after a Session for Magic Items that you didn't deliver but think will likely come up next time.  If a next Session doesn't exist, it will create one.
