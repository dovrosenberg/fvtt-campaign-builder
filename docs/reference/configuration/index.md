# Settings

## Basic settings

- **Start Collapsed**: If set, the directory sidebar will be collapsed when you open the main window.  
- **Display Session Notes**: If set, when you enter "Play Mode", a separate session notes window will automatically popup to make it easier to take notes mid-session.
- **Session Display Mode**: By default, the list of sessions in each campaign shows simply the number of the session in the directory sidebar.  This setting lets you display either the session date or the session name intead.

## Sub-Menus
### Advanced Settings
This is where you configure your backend if you are using Advanced Features.
- **API Token**: The security token that the backend deploy script gives you
- **Backend URL**: The url of the backend server (also provided by the backend deploy script)

### Species List {#species}
This lets you manage the list of species in your worlds.  The default species are from the D&D 5E SRD.  This list is important if you want to track what species your Characters are, but mostly it's to facilitate more accurate descriptions/images when doing AI generation.

### Roll Table Settings
This relates to the roll tables used to rapidly generate NPC names, etc. during play.  They are currently only made for AI generation.
- **Automatically refresh RollTables**: When clicked, the RollTables will replace any used options whenever you restart the module.  This essentially gives you an unlimited supply of unique results.
- **Default types**: If you choose to turn a created name into a fully-fleshed out entry in your Session, these are the types that will be put into the "Type" field by default.  Really just a way to speed up creation.
