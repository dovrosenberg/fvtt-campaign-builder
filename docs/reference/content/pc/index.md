# PC Details

![Campaign content](/assets/images/campaign-content.webp)

The Campaign window provides tools for organizing and managing your campaigns within a Setting. Campaigns allow you to group related sessions together, track player characters, maintain campaign-wide lore, capture ideas, and manage tasks. You can define multiple campaigns within a single Setting, which is useful if you use the same Setting across multiple groups who play at different times.

## Campaign Header

## Tabs
Campaigns have the following tabs where you can manage their details:
* [Description](description)
* [PCs](pcs)
* [Lore](lore)
* [Ideas](ideas)
* [To-Dos](todos)
