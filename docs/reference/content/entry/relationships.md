# Entry relationship tabs
![Relationship tab](/assets/images/relationship-tab.webp)

After the Description tab, every Entry has three "relationship" tabs that are used to show the relationships between them.  For example, two characters might be siblings or an organization might be based in a particular location.

Each tab shows one type of related Entry - [^Characters], [^Locations], and [^Organizations] - but they all work the same way.

## Adding related entries
- Click "Add Location/Organization/Character" to create a new relationship.
- You can also drag and drop any [^Entry] from the [^Setting Directory]onto the box at the top instead.

## Roles
- For the relationship between a Character and either a Location or Organization, there is an extra field available - "Role".  This lets you describe how the Character is related.  For example, Joe might be the "Mayor" of Mainville.  This role is-bidirectional (i.e. if you edit it on the Joe side, you'll see that reflected on the Mainville side).  
-  Characters don't have a role when connected to other characters, in part because those tend to be asymmetrical (ex. Joe is Mary's parent, but Mary isn't Joe's parent).  These situations are better handled in your descriptions for the two Characters.

## The related entry list
- This list shows each of the related Entries.  You can click on the name to open that Entry (hold 'Control' to do it in a new tab).  You can click the Edit button when present to modify the "Role" that describes the relationship.
- Relationships are bi-directional, so creating a relationship, updating the role, and deleting a relationship on one side all automatically impact the Entry on the other side (i.e. if Joe is related to Mainville, then Mainville will be related to Joe).
