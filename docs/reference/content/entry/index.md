# Entry Details
![Entry Window](/assets/images/entry-content.webp)

Regardless of Topic, each Entry has a similar layout in the main window.  At the bottom of this description, we'll outline the things that are different.

## Entry header
The Entry header has three main components:
1. Name - This is where you edit the Entry's name.
2. Generate Button (for Characters, Locations, and Organizations) [Advanced Feature] - This gives you the option to generate a description or image for the current entry.  See [Generate Window] for more details.
3. Tags - See [Tags] documentation.

## Tabs
There are several tabs on the Entry details screen:
- [Description tab](./description) - overview information about the Entry
- [Relationship tabs](./relationships)
- Foundry document tabs: After the Entry relationship tabs, you'll find an [Actors tab](/reference/content/character#actors) when looking at a Character and a [Scenes tab](/reference/content/location#scenes) when looking at a Location.  
- [Sessions tab](./sessions)
