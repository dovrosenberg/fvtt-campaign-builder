# Campaign To-Do Tab

[TODO: screenshot of to do tab]
The To Do list is designed to be a temporary place to store notes of things that you want to better document in your world or campaign.

The To Do tab can be used in two ways:
- It is a place that tracks things that happened during your sessions as a reminder.  Any session item (lore, vignettes, NPCs, locations, etc.) that is delivered in a session is added to the to do list.  Additionally, any world entry (location, character, organization) that you edit while you are in Play Mode (TODO: link that - not tooltip) is added to the list.  The idea is that after each session, you can go through the list and each item will remind you of things that happened and you can decide if you need to: 

  - Add some description to the session notes ("oh right, they saw this cool thing... I forgot to note that")
  - Add a detail to an entry in the world ("oh right, they met this NPC, let me note that I gave her a Scottish accent and then add a new entry for her brother Max that I mentioned she had")

- You can also just add to the list manually fr things you want to remember to do while you're cleaning up the rest of the list.

If an entry is edited during more than one session, you can see the most recent time in the "last modified" field.

The intent is to clean up the list after each session, before preparing for the next, but feel free to use it however you want.  The tab also notes in its header how many items are currently open on the list.

## Source of To-Dos
The system automatically creates to-do items from various sources:
- **Entry** - Notes related to [^Entries] that were edited during a session while in [^Play mode]
- **Session Items** - Notes related to [^Lore], [^Vignettes], [^Relevant Monsters], [^Important NPCs], or [^Magic items] that were marked as delivered during a session
Lore that needs to be delivered

Only one to-do will be created for any given source.  It updates the "last modified" date and the to-do text whenever another would have been created.  That way if you fall behind it doesn't get cluttered, but you can still see all the sessions you might want to check.

You can also manually create a to-do item by clicking the "Create new 'To do'" button on this tab.

## To-Do Management
From the list of to-dos, you can:
- Click the delete button on the row to delete them when they are complete (or you've decided there was nothing to be done).
- Click the edit button (or click on the to-do text) on the row to edit the text. Hit enter to save.
- Click the "Reference" to go to the source.
