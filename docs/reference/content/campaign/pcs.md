![PCs Tab](/assets/images/pcs-tab.webp)

The PCs (Player Characters) tab allows you to track and manage information about the player characters in your campaign. This tab provides:

## Adding PCs
Click the "Add PC" button to create a new PC entry

You can also drag and drop an Actor from Foundry VTT directly onto the PCs list to automatically create a PC entry linked to that Actor

PC names are tied directly to the linked Actors and should be changed from the Actor side.

## PC Information
Each PC entry displays:
- **Name** - The characters and player's names 
- **Character Sheet** - A link to open the character sheet

## PC Management
Click on the PC/player name to open the [PC information window](/reference/content/pc) with plot hooks, etc.

Delete PCs using the action buttons when they're no longer part of the campaign 

> [!WARNING]
> PCs do not exist outside of a campaign, so deleting from this list permenantly deletes all associated info (story hooks, desired magic items, etc.)
