# Organization Details

Organizations add depth and complexity to your campaign world by providing structure for social, political, and economic interactions. An organization could be an important clan, a religious order, a town council, or any other group of people.  The organization details interface is where you can design these structures and how they fit into your setting.

## Overall structure
The overall structure of the Organization Details interface is the common [Entry interface](/reference/content/entry).

## Organization-specific differences
Organizations just have one special detail.

### Parent
Organizations are arranged in a hierarchical structure (that you can see in the [Setting Directory](/reference/navigation/directory-sidebar#setting-directory)).  You can change where an organization is in this hierarchy by:
- Dragging an organization (child) in the Setting Directory and dropping it on another (parent).
- Setting the parent field in the Description tab.  Just start typing and you'll get a filtered list of available organizations.  Delete the parent to make it a top-level organization.
