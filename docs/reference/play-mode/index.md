# Play Mode 
Play Mode is what you use when you're actually running a Session.  You switch in and out of it using the [Prep/Play toggle](/reference/navigation/prep-play) in the Campaign Builder title bar.

## Play Mode Navigation
When in [^Play Mode], several additional UI elements are available to help you run your Sessions:

* [Session notes popup](./session-notes-popup) - A popup that appears when you enter Play Mode to let you take session notes regardless of what tab you're on in the Campaign Builder
* [Session link buttons](./session-links) - A set of buttons that instantly take you to any tab within the Current Session
* [Name generators](./name-generation) - A set of buttons that give you instant name ideas for various types of entities
* [Checkbox in create dialog to add to current session](/reference/world-building/create-entry#options) - An extra option when creating Entries to add them to the Current Session
* [To-do list](/reference/campaign-mgt/content/campaign/todos#automatic-to-dos) - Not actually a new navigation element, but to-do items are automatically created while you're in Play Mode
