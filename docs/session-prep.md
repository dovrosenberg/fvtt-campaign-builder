# Campaign Planning

The Campaign Planning section helps you prepare for your sessions using the Lazy DM method. It provides tools for organizing the key elements of your upcoming session.  You can define multiple campaigns inside a single Setting, which is useful if you use the same setting across multiple groups who play at different times.  

## Campaign Preparation
To create a new campaign:
1. Right click the name of the Setting in the campaign directory (the bottom part of the directory on the right side) and select "Create New Campaign"
2. Provide a name for the campaign

## PCs

The PCs section allows you to track information about player characters.

To add a PC:
1. In your session, click the "PCs" tab
2. Click "Add PC"
3. Fill in the PC details and link to the appropriate Actor
4. Click "Save"

## Creating a campaign

To create a new campaign:
1. Right click on the Session header in the campaign directory (bottom section of the directory and select "Create Campaign"
2. Give the campaign a name

In the settings menu, there is an option to display your sessions in the directory by name, number, or date.

## Session Preparation

To create a new session:
1. Right click on the campaign the session is part of in the campaign directory and select "Create a session"
2. Give the session a name (it can be a placeholder if you like to name your sessions after they're done)

Sessions are identified by number and by name, as well as with a date.  They are currently shown in the directory by number.

Once you've created a session, you can add the various elements described below.

### Session description

On this screen, you can change the session name, number, and date. **Each session must have a unique number within a campaign.**

Sessions are sorted in the campaign directory by number (even if you're displaying them by name or date), and the most recent
session date is used to determing the "current session" when you're in Play mode.

**Note:** Right-click a session or campaign in the campaign directory to delete it.

### Strong Start

The Strong Start is a compelling opening scene or situation that immediately draws players into the action.

To add a Strong Start:
1. In your session, click the "Strong Start" tab
2. Enter your strong start description
3. Click "Save"

### Vignettes

Vignettes are potential scenes that might occur during your session. They're called "vignettes" (vs "Scenes" in Lazy DM parlance) to avoid confusion with Foundry scenes.

To add a vignette:
1. In your session, click the "Vignettes" tab
2. Click "Add Vignette"
3. Fill in the vignette details
4. Click "Save"

During or after the session, you can mark vignettes as "used" or move unused ones to the next session.

### Lore

The Lore section (what the Lazy DM calls "secrets and clues") allows you to prepare bits of information that players might discover during the session.

To add lore:
1. In your session, click the "Lore" tab
2. Click "Add Lore"
3. Fill in the lore details
4. Click "Save"

Like vignettes, you can mark lore as "revealed" during or after the session.

### Campaign Locations

This section allows you to prepare a list of Locations from your Session that might be relevant to the upcoming session.

To add a Location:
1. In your session, click the "Locations" tab
2. Click "Add Location"
3. Select a Location from your Setting and add any session-specific notes
4. Click "Save"

### NPCs

Similar to Locations, this section allows you to prepare a list of NPCs from your Setting that might appear in the upcoming session.

To add an NPC:
1. In your session, click the "NPCs" tab
2. Click "Add NPC"
3. Select a Character from your Setting and add any session-specific notes
4. Click "Save"

### Monsters

The Monsters section allows you to prepare a list of monsters that players might encounter during the session.

To add a monster:
1. In your session, click the "Monsters" tab
2. Drag an actor from somewhere else in Foundry onto the list.
3. You can then click on the "number" to edit it.  Press enter while in the input box to save.

### Magic Items

The Magic Items section allows you to prepare a list of magic items that might appear during the session.

To add a magic item:
